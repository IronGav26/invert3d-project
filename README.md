# _what is the story?_
_you have been a happy bean man your whole life, living in a world of green,
doing the things you do, making the things you make. until it all broke._

_you discovered a chasm in the ground, and fell into it. the next thing you knew,
you awoke atop a platform in a massive void, its only light coming from the lanterns illuminating
the floating platforms, upholding intricate challenges that litter the darkness._

_you found a device that allows you to invert the colors of the space around you, giving
you a new perspective, and allowing you to see things you wouldn't otherwise see._

_you must find the Point of Ascension and go back to the surface. but unfortunately for you...
the platforms you leave crumble behind you._

_there is no turning back._
